	 * principal has been granted. Note that classes should not rely on this value as
	 * being valid unless it has been set by a trusted <code>sAuthenticationManager</code>.
	 * <p>
	 * Implementations should ensure that modifications to the returned collection array
	 * do not affect the state of the Authentication object, or use an unmodifiable
	 * instance.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @return the authorities granted to the principal, or an empty collection if the
	 * token has not been authenticated. Never null.

	 * request with username and password, this would be the username. Callers are
	 * expected to populate the principal for an authentication request.

	 * The <tt>AuthenticationManager</tt> implementation will often return an
	 * <tt>Authentication</tt> containing richer information as the principal for use by

	/**
	 * Used to indicate to {@code AbstractSecurityInterceptor} whether it should present

	 * <code>AuthenticationManager</code> (or, more often, one of its
	 * <code>AuthenticationProvider</code>s) will return an immutable authentication token
	 * after successful authentication, in which case that token can safely return
	 * <code>true</code> to this method. Returning <code>true</code> will improve
	 * performance, as calling the <code>AuthenticationManager</code> for every request
	 * will no longer be necessary.
	 * <p>
	 * For security reasons, implementations of this interface should be very careful
	 * about returning <code>true</code> from this method unless they are either
	 * immutable, or have some way of ensuring the properties have not been changed since
	 * original creation.
	 *
	 * @return true if the token has been authenticated and the
	 * <code>AbstractSecurityInterceptor</code> does not need to present the token to the
	 * <code>AuthenticationManager</code> again for re-authentication.

	 * Implementations should <b>always</b> allow this method to be called with a
	 * <code>false</code> parameter, as this is used by various classes to specify the
	 * authentication token should not be trusted. If an implementation wishes to reject
	 * an invocation with a <code>true</code> parameter (which would indicate the
	 * authentication token is trusted - a potential security risk) the implementation
	 * should throw an {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
	 *
	 * @param isAuthenticated <code>true</code> if the token should be trusted (which may
	 * result in an exception) or <code>false</code> if the token should not be trusted
	 *
	 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if an attempt to make the authentication token
	 * trusted (by passing <code>true</code> as the argument) is rejected due to the
	 * implementation being immutable or implementing its own alternative approach to
	 * {@link #isAuthenticated()}
